* ### Child of Light - Story Trailer

  We like this game because it looks like a storytale, and that's more or less the style we're looking for.
  You can also hear a voice saying some verse just like we want to do.

* ### Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events

  We love the art style in this animation, we would like to create something with this dark style but mixing 3D and 2D.
