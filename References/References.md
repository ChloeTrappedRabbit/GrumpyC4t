* Child of Light - Story Trailer
We like this game because it looks like a storytale, and that's more or less the style we're looking for, you can also hear a voice saying some verse just like we want to do.

* Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events
We love the art style in this animation, we would like to create something with this dark style but mixing 3D and 2D.
