* ### Child of Light - Story Trailer

  Child of Light is a game made by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft, it is a platform and rol game, however, we want to talk about their animations and their style, we love it because it looks like a storytale, and that's more or less the style we're looking for.
  You can also hear a voice saying some verse just like we want to do.

* ### Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events

  Lemony Snicket is an american novelist called Daniel Handler, we love the art style in this animation, we would like to create something with this dark style but mixing 3D and 2D.
